question 1 - for the first question, we were tasked with making 5 bubbles that moved randomly around the canvas from a single class with different functions in it. I created a bubble class and passed parameters through the contructor like the x value, y value, radius, and color. next I called the class 5 different times for 5 different bubbles, each with its own x, y, radius, and color. within the class, I made a move funciton that moved the bubbles around the canvas randomly, and I called this with the bubble.move command 5 times for each bubble name so that each bubble was able to move.
