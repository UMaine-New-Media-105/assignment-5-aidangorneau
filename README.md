question 1 - for the first question, we were tasked with making 5 bubbles that moved randomly around the canvas from a single class with different functions in it. I created a bubble class and passed parameters through the contructor like the x value, y value, radius, and color. next I called the class 5 different times for 5 different bubbles, each with its own x, y, radius, and color. within the class, I made a move funciton that moved the bubbles around the canvas randomly, and I called this with the bubble.move command 5 times for each bubble name so that each bubble was able to move.

question 2 - for the second question, we were tasked with making 50 bubble that moved around the canvas fro ma single class with different functions in it. I created a loop a variable i that operated 50 times and called the bubbles class 50 times, but instead of calling each bubbles class 50 individual times like bubbles[1], bubbles[2], I used i in the variable name like bubbles[i]. this aloud me to have each bubble a random x, y, and r variables, and by calling the move and show functions in draw with another loop based on the length of the bubble list, I made 50 individual bubbles on the screen.

question 3 - for the third question, we were tasked with making a breeder and a catcher and positioning them on the edge of the screen. for my project, I am going with a forest theme which is why I made the bubbles green and brown. I created a cute mouse sprite as my breeder and put it on the left edge of the canvas, and created a cute fox sprite as my catcher and put it on the right edge of the canvas, each with their own functions for drawing and repositioning the sprites as needed.

question 4 - for the forth question, we were tasked with making the breeders and catchers move across the screen randomly with a certain number of each type. I completely revamped the way I implemented the sprites, creating classes for both the foxes and mice, as well as creating loops and empty lists for each in order to spawn them in individually. each class consisted of individual variables as well as moving commands and if statements to check if the sprite hit the edge of the canvas.
